Category: 1D Array

## Solution 
This problem reminded me of using simple data structures to maintain information if possible.
Initially, I thought of using a HashSet to maintain the differences, but realised an Array would suffice.
1. Maintain array of differences for a sequence.
2. Determine whether a sequence was jolly by presence of all numbers.
